1. LICENSE. Work Management Solutions, Inc. hereby grants to Customer a
non-exclusive, non-transferable license (the "License") to use the Licensed
Program and Licensed Materials on the Designated Site, identified on Page 2 of
this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein. The term
of this license is perpetual, commencing upon acceptance of this Agreement by
Work Management Solutions.

This Agreement, the Licensed Program and Licensed Materials to which it applies,
may not be assigned, sub licensed, or transferred by the Customer without prior
written consent from Work Management Solutions which will not be unreasonably
withheld nor delayed.

2. USE. Work Management Solutions shall be responsible for the delivery of the
Licensed Program(s) together with the documentation. The Customer shall be
exclusively responsible for the supervision, management and control of its use
of the Licensed Program(s), including without limitation; (i) assuring proper
machine configurations, audit controls and operating methods: (ii) establishing
adequate backup plans, based on alternative procedures and access to qualified
programming personnel; and (iii) implementing sufficient recovery procedures and
checkpoints to satisfy its requirements for security and accuracy of input, as
well as, system restart and recovery in the event of a malfunction.

The Licensed Program and Licensed Materials may be used only in the furtherance
of the internal operations of the Customer or its wholly owned or majority owned
subsidiaries. In no event shall the Licensed Program be used to process
information by or for the benefit of third parties.

The Customer may, from time to time, change the Designated Site and/or the
location thereof to any computer site of the Customer or a subsidiary, provided
that in each case the Customer gives timely written notice thereof to Work
Management Solutions. During the term of this Agreement, and at any given time,
the Customer is authorized to use the Licensed Program on only one (1) of the
Customer's computers or on a cluster of computers; the Customer may license
additional copies of the Licensed Program pursuant to the then current Work
Management Solutions multiple installation pricing policy.

The Customer may not copy or otherwise reproduce the Licensed Program, or any
part thereof (except such copying, strictly limited in number, as is essential
for system backup, testing, maintenance or recovery purposes). The Customer may
reproduce the Licensed Materials solely for its own internal use provided that
all titles, trademarks, trade names, copyright notices, and other proprietary
notices of Work Management Solutions, Inc. are retained.

3. CONFIDENTIALITY. The ideas and the expressions hereof contained in the
Licensed Program and Licensed Materials are confidential, proprietary
information and trade secrets that the Customer will receive in confidence. The
Customer shall not in any manner or form disclose, provide or otherwise make
available, in whole or in part, any Licensed Program and/or Licensed Materials
to any third parties except for Customer's employees and consultants who are
bound by appropriate non-disclosures. The obligations expressed within this
Section 3 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that all Parties' information that is marked
"Confidential", except as specified below, that comes to be known by reason of
work under this Agreement, is confidential to each Party and will not be
disclosed to unauthorized third parties. The Parties will use the same standard
of care, and will bind their employees, agents or representatives to such
standard, to prevent disclosure of such confidential information as each uses to
protect its own confidential information and trade secrets. Information received
by either Party under this Agreement will not be considered confidential if the
information: (a) is not marked "Confidential"; (b) is known to the other Party
or is in the other Party's possession at the time of executing this Agreement;
(c) is in the public domain at the time of disclosure; (d) is independently
developed by the other Party; or (e) is disclosed to the other Party by a third
party with written approval of the first Party.
